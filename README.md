## Features and Requirements

* The utility is meant to be run on the client machine.
* It is ideally triggered as a logon/logoff script by a Group Policy.
* Any files that the script needs to access should be accessible from a client device.
* It can be used to log to a file, send to Teams or both.
* The utility requires at least PowerShell 5.0.
* This utility has been tested on Windows 10, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server 2012 R2.

### Configuration

Here‚Äôs a list of all the command line switches and example configurations.

| -Logoff | Use this option to log a log off event. | N/A |
| -Teams | The path to a txt file containing the webhook to your Teams instance. Use this option to send a configured event to teams as well as a log file. | \\\server\share\webhook.txt |
| -L | The path to output the log file to. The file name will be Logon-Audit.log. Do not add a trailing \ backslash. | \\\server\share |
